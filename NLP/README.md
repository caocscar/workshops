# Intro to Natural Language Processing

This 2.5 hr workshop covers the following Python packages: 
- `spaCy` (tagger, parser, named-entity recognition)
- `textacy` (n-grams)
- `gensim` (topic modelling)
- `pyLDAvis` (visualization)
- `textblob` (sentiment analysis)

My student, Ellen Paquet, prepared the workshop materials. Her original repo is located at https://github.com/epmarie/IntroNLP
